## Localization Terminology

### Generalized:
any **bilaterally synchronous and symmetric** pattern, even if it has a restricted field (e.g., bifrontal)

### Lateralized: 
unilateral; 
OR bilateral but clearly and consistently higher amplitude in one hemisphere (bilateral asymmetric); 
OR bilateral but with a consistent lead-in from the same side (bilateral asynschronous)

#### Decision Logic:
    If unilateral: L
    Elif bilateral:
        if not synchronous: L
        elif not symmetric: L
        else: G

## Pattern Terminology

### Periodic Discharges:

* Periodic: repetition of a waveform with relatively uniform morphology and duration with a clearly discernible interdischarge interval between consecutive waveforms and recurrence of the waveform at nearly regular intervals. "Nearly regular intervals" is defined as having a period varying by $<50\%$ from one cycle to the next in $>50\%$ of the cycle pairs.
* Discharges: Waveforms lasting $<0.5$ seconds, regardless of number of phases, or waveforms $\ge 0.5$ seconds with no more than 3 phases. Discharges must clearly stand out from the background activity.

### Rhythmic Delta Activity:

* Rhythmic: Repetition of a waveform with relatively uniform morphology and duration and without an interval between consecutive waveforms. The duration of one cycle should vary by $<50\%$ from the duration of the subsequent cycle for $>50\%$ of the cycle pairs. 
* Delta Activity: Activity $0.5$ to $\le 4.0$ Hz.

### Electrographic Seizure:

* Epileptiform discharges averaging $>2.5$ Hz for $\ge 10$ seconds ($>25$ discharges in $10$ seconds), OR
* Any pattern with definite evolution and lasting $\ge 10$ seconds.

## Evolution

At least two unequivocal, sequential changes in frequency, morphology, or location:

* Evolution in frequency: at least two consecutive changes in the same direction by at least $0.5$ Hz.
* Evolution in morphology: at least two consecutive changes to a novel morphology.
* Evolution in location: sequentially spreading into or sequentially out of at least two different standard 10-20 electrode locations.
